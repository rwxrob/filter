The {{cmd .Name}} command replaces any apparent YouTube URL with that same URL but wrapped in angle brackets and with an optional prefix (default ğŸ“º). If the URL is already wrapped with angle brackets it is skipped.

If no arguments are passes, assumes standard input.

If single argument is passed, assumes file name.
